## Waltteri
Waltteri's individual tasks were add and edit functions for questions, read function and .jsp for candidates. 
Some of the tasks were assigned to the team and everyone participated on those.
If someone had any problems, the team would come and help.
## Joona
First sprint I had the task "creating code that runs questions into database" assigned, but I ended up
working on the code that edits, reads and removes questions from the database.

During our second sprint I continued working on the codes, as they were still on-going tasks.

Third sprint I worked on making setters and getters for our candidates. Also worked on the code
that updates the candidates on our database.
